\# Contributing Guidelines



\## Branching strategy

\- `main` – production-ready code

\- `develop` – integration branch

\- `feature/\*` – all development work



Direct commits to `main` and `develop` are not allowed.



\## Pull Requests

\- All changes must go through a Pull Request

\- PRs must target `develop`

\- CI must be green before merge



\## Commit messages

We follow Conventional Commits:

\- feat:

\- fix:

\- refactor:

\- test:

\- docs:

\- chore:



\## Definition of Done

A task is considered DONE when:

\- Code is implemented

\- CI pipeline passes

\- Tests are added or updated

\- Database migrations are included (if needed)

\- Documentation is updated (if needed)
